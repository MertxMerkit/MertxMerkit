# 👋 Hi, I’m Mert Merkit

**Cybersecurity • SOC • Incident Response • IT Operations**

I am a cybersecurity professional focused on **defensive security**, particularly **SOC processes**, **incident response**, and analytical operational workflows.  
I analyze security events not as isolated alerts, but through cause-and-effect reasoning — just like a real SOC analyst does.

My approach combines **defense mindset with attacker understanding**: defenders become stronger by knowing offensive techniques.
